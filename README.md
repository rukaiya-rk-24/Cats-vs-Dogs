# Cats-vs-Dogs
I made a Convolution neural network model which is able to identify a cat and dog image and differentiate between them.
I have got the training accuracy of 95% and validation accuracy is 90%.
I have used the data available on Tensorflow and can be accessed by the link https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cats_vs_dogs
I have used 4 Convolutional layers and 4 MaxPooling layers with 3 Dense layers.
I have used RMSprop optimizer and binary crossentropy as the loss function.
